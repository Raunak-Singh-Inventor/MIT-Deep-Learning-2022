# MIT-Deep-Learning-2022
My repo for the MIT Deep Learning 2022 Youtube Course.

Intro to TensorFlow & Music Generation Lab 1 folder: 

* Part1_TensorFlow.ipynb - cover the basics of TensorFlow

* Part2_Music_Generation.ipynb  - train a RNN model to generate new music after looking at numerous traditional irish folk songs
  
  * my completed exercises
  * my model training script and hyperparameters
  * model inference code to generate new music from a starting character ("X:")

* experiments.ods - spreadsheet with all of the experiments I did to optimize the model I built in part 2 
  
Note: mdl library only works in Colab
